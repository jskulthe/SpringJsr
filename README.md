# SpringJsr

Demonstrated Spring Caching using JSR107 annotations and Multiple caches
1. Caffeine Cache
2. ConcurrentMap Cache

We can use different caches at method level, but in this project I have just configured one cache at a time.
If we have to change Cache Implementation, just change Application.properties file.
That's only configuration required and project should run.
